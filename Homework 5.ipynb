    "which has the solution $V(x)=ax+b$, where $a$ and $b$ are constants determined by the boundary conditions. A common strategy for solving such a differential equation numerically is to start with an initial guess for the solution, and then gradually \"relax\" this guess towards the true solution through iteration. One way to do this is with the so-called \"Gauss-Seidel\" update rule. First we discretize the solution along the domain of interest, $x=j*a$, where $a$ is the step size. We fix the solution at the end points and update the values in between from iteration step $n$ to $n+1$ according to the equation\n",

    "\n",
    "The sample program below illustrates this method for a choice of $V_0 = 0$ and $V_N = 10$. You can see how the (quite bad) initial guess evolves towards the correct solution as n increases."
