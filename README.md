PHYS 301: Electrodynamics Numerical Analysis

This repository contains Python code in Jupyter Lab Notebooks for numerical analysis of electrodynamics problems. These include:

* using the Method of Relaxation to solve the Laplace Equation

* finding numerical results to differential equations 

* plotting the results using `matplotlib.pyplot`
